## Introduction

Git is an open source, distributed version-control system (VCS). Essentially, it is a program which tracks changes to a collection of files and and allows multiple users to share and work on files at the same time without affecting each other (mostly).

## Overview

-   Installation
-   Configuration
-   Setup/Clone Repositories

## Installation

Git (All Platforms) - https://git-scm.com/downloads

Git Credential Manager (Windows/Mac/Linux) - https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/blob/release/docs/install.md

GitHub Desktop (Windows/Mac/Linux) - https://desktop.github.com/

## Configuration

After installing Git, you will need to open a commandline window such as Git Bash, Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, etc. Git Bash comes bundled alongside the Windows installation of Git. You will need to set up your identity, namely an email and username associated with any commits you make with Git.

The following command sets the name you want attached to commits

```
git config --global user.name "your name"
```

Next, set the email associated with your commits. This email does not have to be your GitHub account email, it can be any email you want to use. However, it's recommended to use your GitHub email.

```
git config --global user.email "youraddress@email.com"
```

Now you're set to get started with Git!
